The default interface is very basic in that it will show the most important
part to get started with ShimanoRDP. We will explain more details of the interface
further on this document.


Customization
=============
.. seealso::

   :doc:`/keyboard_shortcuts` - For keybindings in ShimanoRDP

ShimanoRDP supports themes and keyboard shortcuts.

.. note::

	Keyboard shortcuts can be overwritten when a connection is active. Since the connection might use the same shortcut

The ShimanoRDP shortcuts will work when the interface is in focus but not so often when the remote connection is active.

Themes
------
These can be chosen from the :menuselection:`Tools --> Options`.
There are also possibilities to create your own themes inside the settings for themes.
By default ShimanoRDP has turned off the themes but they are easily
enabled by choosing another theme rather then the default (vs2015light) one.

.. warning::

	In order for the theme to load, ShimanoRDP needs to be restarted
